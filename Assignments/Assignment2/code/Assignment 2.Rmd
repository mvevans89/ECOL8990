# Exercise 1

*Using the ‘Growth.csv’ file in the Assignment 2 folder, fit two nonlinear models relating growth rate to diameter: a Ricker and a quadratic. Include a plot showing the raw data and the two fitted lines in your Markdown document.*


```{r}
growth <- read.csv("../data/Growth.csv")
#ricker
rickForm <- as.formula(Growth~Diameter*exp(r*(1-Diameter/k)))
rickMod <- nls(rickForm, 
               data=growth, 
               start=list(r=1.5, k=20))
lines(x=0:50, y=predict(rickMod, data.frame(Diameter=0:50)))
```
