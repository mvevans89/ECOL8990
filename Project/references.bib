	abstract = {Dengue is a vector-borne disease transmitted by the mosquito Aedes aegypti. The incidence of dengue disease shows a clear dependence on seasonal variation. How does the temperature affect the incidence? We addressed this question indirectly by estimating the size of the A. aegypti population for different temperatures applying population dynamics theory. In order to achieve this objective we designed temperature-controlled experiments to assess the entomological parameters regarding the mosquito's life-cycle at different temperatures. By obtaining the mortality, transition and oviposition rates for different stages of the life-cycle of the mosquito we were able to calculate the basic offspring number Q(0), which is the capacity of vector reproduction and ultimately gives the size of the vector population.},

	abstract = {Urban heat island is among the most evident aspects of human impacts on the earth system. Here we assess the diurnal and seasonal variation of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) defined as the surface temperature difference between urban area and suburban area measured from the MODIS. Differences in SUHII are analyzed across 419 global big cities, and we assess several potential biophysical and socio-economic driving factors. Across the big cities, we show that the average annual daytime SUHII (1.5 ± 1.2 °C) is higher than the annual nighttime SUHII (1.1 ± 0.5 °C) (P {\textless} 0.001). But no correlation is found between daytime and nighttime SUHII across big cities (P = 0.84), suggesting different driving mechanisms between day and night. The distribution of nighttime SUHII correlates positively with the difference in albedo and nighttime light between urban area and suburban area, while the distribution of daytime SUHII correlates negatively across cities with the difference of vegetation cover and activity between urban and suburban areas. Our results emphasize the key role of vegetation feedbacks in attenuating SUHII of big cities during the day, in particular during the growing season, further highlighting that increasing urban vegetation cover could be one effective way to mitigate the urban heat island effect.},

	abstract = {A model for predicting diurnal changes in soil and air temperatures given the maximum and minimum temperatures has been developed. The model uses a truncated sine wave to predict daytime temperature changes and an exponential function to predict nighttime temperatures. The model is based upon hourly soil and air temperatures for 1977 at a shortgrass prairie site and is parameterized for 150-cm and 10-cm air temperatures and for soil-surface and 10-cm soil temperatures. The absolute mean error for the model ranged from a maximum of 2.64°C for the 10-cm air temperature to a minimum of 1.20°C for the 10-cm soil temperature. The model was also parameterized for hourly air temperature data for Denver, Colorado. Comparison of the model with other models showed that it did a superior job of fitting the data with a smaller number of parameters.},
